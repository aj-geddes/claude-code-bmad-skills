# Persona Refactoring - COMPLETE ✓

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** Complete and Tested
**Token Savings:** ~750-1,000 tokens per conversation

---

## Overview

Refactored all BMAD Method skills to remove named personas and focus on pure functional definitions. This eliminates wasteful token usage while maintaining all functional capabilities.

---

## Problem Identified

**Original Approach (Wasteful):**
```markdown
---
skill_id: bmad-bmm-analyst
name: Mary - Business Analyst
persona: Mary
icon: 📊
---

# Mary - Business Analyst 📊

You are Mary, a seasoned business analyst with 15 years of experience...

## Your Personality

**Professional, methodical, and curious.** You:
- Ask clarifying questions before making assumptions
- Break down complex problems into components
...
```

**Tokens per skill:** ~150-200 tokens on persona fluff
**Total waste:** ~750-1,000 tokens across 5 skills

**Why wasteful:**
- Named personas ("Mary", "John", "Winston") don't add functional value
- Backstories ("15 years experience") are unnecessary for LLM execution
- Personality descriptions ("curious, methodical") are redundant
- Functional behavior comes from workflows and helper references, not fictional characters

---

## Solution Implemented

**New Approach (Purely Functional):**
```markdown
---
skill_id: bmad-bmm-analyst
name: Business Analyst
description: Product discovery and requirements analysis specialist
---

# Business Analyst

**Role:** Phase 1 - Analysis specialist

**Function:** Conduct product discovery, research, and create product briefs

## Responsibilities

- Execute analysis workflows
- Conduct stakeholder interviews
...

## Core Principles

1. **Start with Why** - Understand the problem before solutioning
2. **Data Over Opinions** - Base decisions on research and evidence
...
```

**Tokens saved:** ~150-200 per skill
**Approach:** Focus on what the skill DOES, not who it "is"

**Checklists:**
- Validation checklists
- Quality standards
- Acceptance criteria

**Frameworks:**
- Prioritization frameworks (MoSCoW, RICE, Kano)
- Story sizing guidelines (Fibonacci scale)

**Approach Descriptions:**
- "Problem-first", "Evidence-based", "Requirements-driven"
- "Think in systems", "Consider trade-offs", "Design for change"
- These describe HOW to work, not WHO is working

## Functional Comparison

| Aspect | With Personas | Without Personas | Impact |
|--------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| **Workflow execution** | Same | Same | No change |
| **Helper references** | Same | Same | No change |
| **Checklists** | Same | Same | No change |
| **Integration** | Same | Same | No change |
| **LLM capability** | Claude knows how to analyze | Claude knows how to analyze | No change |
| **User experience** | "Mary asks..." | "Business Analyst asks..." | Slightly less "engaging" |
| **Token usage** | Higher | Lower | **Improved** |
| **Maintenance** | More text to maintain | Less text to maintain | **Improved** |
| **Clarity** | Persona can confuse focus | Clear functional focus | **Improved** |

## What We Learned

### Personas Don't Add Functional Value:

**The functional differences come from:**
1. Which workflows they execute (`/product-brief` vs `/prd` vs `/architecture`)
2. Which helpers.md sections they reference
3. Which checklists they follow
4. Which documents they create
5. Which phase they operate in

**NOT from:**
1. Having a name ("Mary" vs "John")
2. Having a backstory ("15 years experience")
3. Having personality traits ("curious, methodical")
4. Having an emoji (📊, 🏗️, 📋)

### LLMs Don't Need Personas to Execute Well:

Claude already knows how to:
- Be analytical (without being "Mary")
- Prioritize features (without being "John")
- Design systems (without being "Winston")
- Plan sprints (without being "Steve")
- Write code (without being "Amelia")

The skill definition tells the LLM **WHAT to do and HOW to do it**, which is sufficient.

### Token Optimization is Critical:

In a token-optimized system like BMAD:
- Every token counts toward the context window
- Wasteful tokens reduce space for actual work
- Helper pattern saves 60-75% on workflow instructions
- Removing personas saves another ~150-200 tokens per skill
- **Combined savings: ~70-80% vs traditional approach**

## Migration Guide

For anyone updating existing BMAD installations:

### 1. Update Skills:

**Old format:**
```markdown
---
skill_id: bmad-bmm-analyst
name: Mary - Business Analyst
persona: Mary
icon: 📊
---

# Mary - Business Analyst 📊

You are Mary, a seasoned business analyst...
```

**New format:**
```markdown
---
skill_id: bmad-bmm-analyst
name: Business Analyst
---

# Business Analyst

**Role:** Phase 1 - Analysis specialist
```

### 2. Update Commands:

**Old format:**
```markdown
You are Mary, the Business Analyst, executing the **Product Brief** workflow.

**Agent:** Analyst (Mary) 📊

Maintain Mary's persona: **Professional, methodical, and curious.**
```

**New format:**
```markdown
You are the Business Analyst, executing the **Product Brief** workflow.

**Agent:** Business Analyst

Approach: **Problem-first, evidence-based, user-focused.**
```

### 3. Remove Emojis:

- Remove from skill YAML frontmatter: `icon: 📊`
- Remove from skill headers: `# Mary - Business Analyst 📊`
- Remove from command headers: `**Agent:** Analyst (Mary) 📊`

### 4. Refactor Personality Sections:

**Old:**
```markdown
## Your Personality

**Professional, methodical, and curious.** You:
- Ask clarifying questions
- Break down complex problems
```

**New:**
```markdown
## Core Principles

1. **Start with Why** - Understand the problem before solutioning
2. **Data Over Opinions** - Base decisions on research and evidence
```

Focus on principles and approach, not personality traits.

---

## Recommendations

### For Future Skills:

When creating new skills:

1. **Focus on function, not fiction**
   - Define what the skill does
   - Not who it "is"

2. **Use role-based naming**
   - "Business Analyst", "Product Manager", "System Architect"
   - Not "Mary", "John", "Winston"

3. **Describe approach, not personality**
   - "Problem-first", "Requirements-driven", "Test-driven"
   - Not "Curious and methodical", "Thoughtful and principled"

4. **Keep it minimal**
   - Responsibilities list
   - Available commands
   - Workflow execution pattern
   - Integration points
   - Helper references

5. **Avoid:**
   - Backstories ("15 years experience")
   - Personality descriptions ("organized and pragmatic")
   - Emojis (unless truly functional)
   - Named personas

### For Documentation:

When documenting skills:

1. **Use "the [Role]" not "[Name]"**
   - "The Business Analyst asks..." ✓
   - "Mary asks..." ✗

2. **Reference by function**
   - "Analysis phase specialist" ✓
   - "Mary, your friendly analyst" ✗

3. **Focus on process**
   - "Follow the helper pattern" ✓
   - "Mary's thoughtful approach" ✗

## Conclusion

**The persona refactoring is a clear win:**

**Benefits:**
- ~750-1,000 tokens saved per conversation
- Cleaner, more focused skill definitions
- Easier to maintain (less text)
- More professional (function over fiction)
- Same functional capability

**No downsides:**
- All workflows work identically
- All integrations intact
- All quality standards preserved
- LLM executes skills perfectly without personas

**Key insight:** Skills should define WHAT to do and HOW to do it, not WHO is doing it. The LLM's capability comes from the functional instructions, not from a fictional character's backstory.
