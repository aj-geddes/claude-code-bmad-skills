## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Claude Code Starts

When Claude Code initializes:
1. Reads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (1,250 token lightweight prompt)
2. BMAD detection runs **first** (new priority)
3. Loads relevant skill files based on context

### 2. BMAD Detection

Claude automatically detects BMAD projects by checking for:
- `bmad-agent/` directory
- `.bmad-initialized` marker file
- `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`

**If BMAD detected:**
- Loads BMAD methodology from skill file
- Reads PRD and Architecture
- Activates appropriate agent role
- Follows BMAD workflow

**If BMAD not detected:**
- Continues with standard development practices
- Can suggest BMAD for appropriate projects

### 3. Skill Loading

Skills are loaded on-demand based on:
- **Security**: Always considered for all code
- **Language**: Loaded when working with specific languages
- **DevOps**: Loaded for infrastructure/deployment work
- **Testing**: Loaded when writing or running tests
- **Git**: Loaded for version control operations

### 4. Context References

CLAUDE.md v2.0 references skills like:
```
**Security First**
- Input validation, least privilege, OWASP guidelines
- [Details: ~/.claude/skills/security/SKILL.md]

**Quality Standards**
- Clean, idiomatic code; testable, maintainable
- Language-specific guidelines per Architecture doc
- [Details: ~/.claude/skills/{language}/SKILL.md]
```

## ✅ Verification

Test your installation:

```bash
# 1. Verify global prompt
ls -la ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# 2. Verify BMAD files
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/bmad-method/

# 3. Verify all skill files
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md

# 4. Test bmad-init script
bmad-init --check-only

# Should output: "Status: BMAD Not Present" (if run outside BMAD project)
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Starting a New Project

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/myproject

# Let Claude analyze if BMAD would help
# Claude will automatically detect and suggest

# Or initialize BMAD manually
bmad-init

# Follow prompts to scaffold structure
```

### Working on Existing Project

Claude automatically:
1. Checks for BMAD structure
2. Loads relevant skills based on files being worked on
3. References Architecture doc for tech decisions
4. Applies language-specific best practices

### Accessing Skill Knowledge

Claude automatically reads skills when needed:
- Writing Python? → Loads Python skill
- Setting up CI/CD? → Loads DevOps skill
- Writing tests? → Loads Testing skill
- Security review? → Loads Security skill

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Skills

1. Create skill directory:
```bash
mkdir ~/.claude/skills/your-skill-name
```

2. Create SKILL.md following pattern in `ORGANIZATION.md`

3. Reference from CLAUDE.md:
```
**Your Topic**
- Brief description
- [Details: ~/.claude/skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md]
```

### Updating Existing Skills

Simply edit the SKILL.md files:
```bash
vim ~/.claude/skills/python/SKILL.md
```

Changes take effect in new Claude Code sessions.

## 📊 System Metrics

### Before Refactor
- CLAUDE.md: ~3,500 tokens
- All knowledge embedded in single file
- Python-biased
- Conflicted with BMAD

### After Refactor
- CLAUDE.md: 1,250 tokens (65% reduction)
- Modular skill system (7 files)
- Language-agnostic
- BMAD-first approach
- 3,000+ lines of comprehensive guidance
- Easier to maintain and extend

## 🎓 Learning Path

### For New Users
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` - Understand core principles
2. Read `BMAD-METHOD-SKILL.md` - Learn BMAD workflow
3. Explore language-specific skills as needed

### For BMAD Projects
1. Initialize with `bmad-init`
2. Follow Planning Phase (Analyst → PM → Architect)
3. Transition to Development Phase (SM → Dev → QA)
4. Let Claude enforce methodology automatically

### For Standard Projects
1. Claude applies general best practices
2. Language-specific skills load automatically
3. Security and testing always considered
4. Git best practices enforced

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Claude not detecting BMAD
```bash
# Check for required markers
ls -la bmad-agent/
ls -la .bmad-initialized
ls -la docs/{prd,architecture}.md

# Re-initialize if needed
bmad-init --force
```

### Skill not loading
```bash
# Verify file exists and is readable
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md

# Check file permissions
chmod 644 ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

### Script not executable
```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/bmad-method/bmad-init.sh
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

All skill files contain security guidance:
- Input validation patterns
- Authentication best practices
- Secrets management
- OWASP Top 10 prevention
- Container security
- Infrastructure hardening

Security skill is **always** consulted for code work.

## 🚦 Next Steps

1. **Install the system** (5 minutes)
2. **Try on a new project** - Let Claude suggest BMAD
3. **Explore the skills** - See comprehensive guidance
4. **Customize as needed** - Add your own skills
5. **Share improvements** - Contribute back to the system

## 📝 Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Review skills quarterly
- Update with new best practices
- Add new patterns as learned
- Keep dependency versions current

### Version Control
Consider tracking your customizations:
```bash
cd ~/.claude
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Claude Code configuration"
```

## 🎉 You're Ready!

The complete BMAD Code Skill system is installed and ready to use. Claude will now:

✅ Detect and enforce BMAD methodology automatically  
✅ Apply language-specific best practices  
✅ Maintain security-first approach
