## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Sprint Planning & Implementation

Run `/sprint-planning` to:
- Break epics into detailed user stories
- Estimate story complexity
- Plan sprint iterations
- Begin implementation following this architectural blueprint

**Key Implementation Principles:**
1. Follow component boundaries defined in this document
2. Implement NFR solutions as specified
3. Use technology stack as defined
4. Follow API contracts exactly
5. Adhere to security and performance guidelines
