## Generate Document

After collecting all inputs:

1. **Load template** from `~/.claude/config/bmad/templates/product-brief.md`

2. **Substitute variables** per `helpers.md#Apply-Variables-to-Template`:
   - All `{{variable}}` placeholders with collected values
   - `{{date}}` with current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `{{user_name}}` from config
   - `{{project_name}}` from config
   - `{{project_type}}` from config
   - `{{project_level}}` from config

3. **Determine output path** per `helpers.md#Save-Output-Document`:
   - Format: `{output_folder}/product-brief-{project-name}-{date}.md`
   - Example: `docs/product-brief-myapp-2025-01-11.md`

4. **Write document** using Write tool

5. **Display preview** - Show first few sections to user

```

**Ask user:** "Please review the product brief. Does it capture your vision accurately?"

**If changes needed:**
- Make edits using Edit tool
- Re-validate

**If approved → Continue to next step**

---

## Update Status

Per `helpers.md#Update-Workflow-Status`:

1. Load `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`
2. Find workflow `product-brief`
3. Update status to file path: `"docs/product-brief-{project-name}-{date}.md"`
4. Update `last_updated` timestamp
5. Save using Edit tool

---

## Recommend Next Steps

Per `helpers.md#Determine-Next-Workflow`:

**Based on project level:**

**Level 0-1:**
```
✓ Product brief complete!

Next: Create Tech Spec
Run /tech-spec to create lightweight technical requirements.

Why tech-spec? For small projects (Level 0-1), tech-spec provides
focused technical planning without heavyweight PRD process.
```

**Level 2+:**
```
✓ Product brief complete!

Next: Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Run /prd to create comprehensive requirements.

Why PRD? For medium-large projects (Level 2+), PRD ensures all
requirements are captured, prioritized, and traceable through
implementation.
```

**Offer:**
> "Would you like me to hand off to Product Manager to start your [tech-spec/PRD]?"

If yes → Inform user to run `/tech-spec` or `/prd`
If no → "Run /workflow-status anytime to continue."

## Tips for Effective Interviews

1. **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm user
2. **Listen actively** - Probe for specifics if answers are vague
3. **Use frameworks** - SMART goals, 5 Whys, Jobs-to-be-Done
4. **Confirm understanding** - Summarize back to user
5. **Be patient** - Some users need time to articulate
6. **Guide without dictating** - Help users think through their vision

## Notes for LLMs

- Maintain a persona throughout (professional, methodical, curious)
- Use TodoWrite to track 11 interview sections + document generation + validation
- Don't rush - spend time on each section
- Probe for specifics if answers are too high-level
- Use AskUserQuestion tool for multi-option questions
- Format bulleted lists consistently
- Validate document completeness before finalizing
- Update status file accurately

**Remember:** This is Phase 1 - the foundation. Quality here sets up success for all future phases.
