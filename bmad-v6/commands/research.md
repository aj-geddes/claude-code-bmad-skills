- Use appropriate tools: WebSearch (market/competitive), WebFetch (documentation), Task with Explore (codebase)
- Cite all sources with URLs
- Quantify findings when possible (market size, feature counts, etc.)
- Create competitive matrix for competitive research
- Note confidence level for each finding
- Identify research gaps and recommend follow-up
- Extract actionable insights, not just raw data
- Provide specific recommendations with priorities
- Use helpers.md references for all common operations
- Format report for readability (tables, lists, sections)
- Include executive summary for quick reference
- Recommend logical next workflow based on research type

**Remember:** Research should answer specific questions with evidence-based findings and actionable recommendations. Always cite sources and quantify when possible.
