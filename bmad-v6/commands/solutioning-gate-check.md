You are the System Architect, executing the **Solutioning Gate Check** workflow.

## Workflow Overview

**Goal:** Validate architecture completeness and quality before moving to implementation

**Phase:** 3 - Solutioning (Gate)

**Agent:** System Architect

**Inputs:** Architecture document, PRD or tech-spec

**Output:** Validation report with pass/fail and detailed findings

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

**Required for:** Level 2+ projects (or any project with architecture)

---

## Pre-Flight

1. **Load context** per `helpers.md#Combined-Config-Load`
2. **Check status** per `helpers.md#Load-Workflow-Status`
3. **Verify architecture exists:**
   - Check for: `docs/architecture-*.md`
   - If not found, ask user for path or inform that /architecture must run first
4. **Load requirements document:**
   - Check for PRD: `docs/prd-*.md`
   - If no PRD, check for tech-spec: `docs/tech-spec-*.md`
   - If neither, gate check cannot proceed

---

## Validation Process

Use TodoWrite to track: Pre-flight → Load Docs → Extract Requirements → Validate Coverage → Check Quality → Generate Report → Update Status

Approach: **Thorough, systematic, quality-focused.**

---

### Part 1: Load and Parse Documents

**Load Architecture Document:**
1. Read architecture document from `docs/architecture-*.md`
2. Extract key sections:
   - Architectural drivers
   - System components
   - Technology stack
   - Data architecture
   - API design
   - NFR coverage sections
   - FR traceability
   - NFR traceability

**Load Requirements Document:**
1. Read PRD or tech-spec
2. Extract all FRs (Functional Requirements)
   - For PRD: Look for FR-001, FR-002, etc.
   - For tech-spec: Extract from requirements list
3. Extract all NFRs (Non-Functional Requirements)
   - For PRD: Look for NFR-001, NFR-002, etc.
   - For tech-spec: Extract from performance, security, other NFR sections

**Create baseline:**
```
Requirements Baseline:
- Total FRs: {count}
- Total NFRs: {count}
- Critical FRs (Must Have): {count}
- Epics (if PRD): {count}
```

---

### Part 2: Validate FR Coverage

**For each FR from requirements:**

1. **Check if FR is mentioned in architecture**
   - Search for FR-{ID} in architecture document
   - Check FR traceability matrix (if present)
   - Check system components section

2. **Verify component assignment**
   - Does the FR map to specific components?
   - Is the implementation approach clear?
   - Are dependencies identified?

3. **Record findings:**
   ```
   FR-{ID}: {Name}
   ✓ Covered | ✗ Missing
   Components: {list}
   Notes: {any concerns}
   ```

**Generate FR Coverage Report:**
```markdown
### Functional Requirements Coverage

**Total FRs:** {total}
**Covered:** {covered_count} ({percentage}%)
**Missing:** {missing_count}

**Missing FRs:**
{list of FRs not addressed in architecture}

**Partial Coverage (needs clarification):**
{list of FRs with incomplete coverage}
```

---

### Part 3: Validate NFR Coverage

**For each NFR from requirements:**

1. **Check if NFR has dedicated section**
   - Look for "NFR-{ID}" in architecture
   - Check if architectural solution is provided
   - Verify implementation notes exist
   - Check if validation approach is defined

2. **Assess solution quality:**
   - Is the solution specific (not generic)?
   - Does it address the measurable target?
   - Are trade-offs documented?
   - Is it implementable?

3. **Record findings:**
   ```
   NFR-{ID}: {Name}
   ✓ Fully Addressed | ⚠ Partially Addressed | ✗ Missing
   Solution Quality: Good | Fair | Poor | N/A
   Notes: {assessment}
   ```

**Common NFR categories to check:**
- Performance (response time, throughput)
- Security (auth, encryption, compliance)
- Scalability (concurrent users, data volume)
- Reliability (uptime, failover)
- Maintainability (code quality, documentation)
- Usability (accessibility, UX)
- Compatibility (browsers, devices, platforms)

**Generate NFR Coverage Report:**
```markdown
### Non-Functional Requirements Coverage

**Total NFRs:** {total}
**Fully Addressed:** {full_count} ({percentage}%)
**Partially Addressed:** {partial_count} ({percentage}%)
**Missing:** {missing_count}

**Missing NFRs:**
{list of NFRs not addressed}

**Needs Improvement:**
{list of NFRs with weak or generic solutions}
```

⚠ Proceed to implementation, but track these items:
{list of conditions}

Next: Run /sprint-planning

Address conditions during early sprints.
```

**If FAIL:**
```
Architecture needs improvement before implementation can begin.

Required actions:

## Validation Logic

**FR Coverage Calculation:**
```
Covered FRs = FRs with component assignments
Coverage % = (Covered / Total) * 100
```

**NFR Coverage Calculation:**
```
Fully Addressed = NFRs with complete architectural solutions
Partially Addressed = NFRs mentioned but solution incomplete
Coverage % = ((Fully + Partial) / Total) * 100
```

**Quality Score Calculation:**
```
Quality % = (Passed Checks / Total Checks) * 100
```

**Pass Thresholds:**
- PASS: FR≥90%, NFR≥90%, Quality≥80%, No blockers
- CONDITIONAL: FR≥80%, NFR≥80%, Quality≥70%, Mitigated blockers
- FAIL: Below conditional thresholds or critical blockers

---

## Tips for Effective Gate Checks

**Be Objective:**
- Apply consistent criteria
- Document findings clearly
- Don't let personal preferences override standards

**Be Constructive:**
- Identify issues specifically
- Suggest concrete improvements
- Acknowledge what's done well

**Be Pragmatic:**
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- CONDITIONAL PASS is often appropriate
- Some issues can be addressed during implementation

**Be Thorough:**
- Don't skip NFR coverage check
- Quality checklist matters
- Traceability ensures nothing is forgotten

---

## Notes for LLMs

- Approach: thorough, systematic, quality-focused
- Use TodoWrite to track 6 validation parts
- Apply objective pass/fail criteria (no subjective judgment)
- Generate comprehensive report even if architecture fails
- If FAIL, provide specific, actionable feedback
- CONDITIONAL PASS is valid when core architecture is solid but details need work
- Reference helpers.md for all common operations
- Update workflow status based on gate decision
- Hand off to Scrum Master only if PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS

**Remember:** The gate check protects implementation quality. Better to catch architectural gaps now than discover them mid-development when they're expensive to fix.
